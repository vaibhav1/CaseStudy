# Case Study

## Assignment

We have a list of reviews about each hotel in our database. We would like you to build a tool that lets us compare different hotels.

The tool receives as input:
* A list of reviews for each hotel.
* The topic we are interested in.

The tool provides as output:
* An overview of which hotel scores best on the given topic.
* Useful statistics about the processed reviews.

You should score hotels based on whether the reviews speak positively or negatively about the given topic. A topic is something like *room*, or *breakfast*, or *spa*. Take into account that multiple words can indicate the same topic, like *staff* and *personnel*.

## Tips

* Deliver your code to us as a (git) repository: we want to be able to see your commit history.
* We'd rather see half the features fully finished than all the features half finished.
* We suggest you spend no more than six hours on the code; it's fine if you don't finish.
* Provide clear and complete instructions on how to run your code.
* Another developer should be able to maintain your code, so provide documentation and make your code readable.
* Explain why you solved the problem the way you did. You can do this with text, audio, image, or video; whichever you want.
